# Traffic-Sign-Board-Detection
A regular CNN model (VGG19) and perform grad-CAM 
Objective: The objective of the project is to detect traffic sign boards in an image and classify them into various categories.

Dataset: The dataset used for the project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which consists of images of various traffic signs.

Methodology: The project uses the following methodology for traffic sign board detection:

Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed using techniques such as resizing, normalization, and gray-scaling.
Feature extraction: The project extracts features from the preprocessed images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction technique.
Classification: The project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the extracted features into various traffic sign board categories.
Evaluation: The project evaluates the performance of the traffic sign board detection model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results: The project achieves a high accuracy rate of 96% on the test dataset, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for traffic sign board 
detection.

Conclusion: The project concludes that the proposed methodology for traffic sign board detection can be used in real-world applications such as autonomous driving 
systems, traffic management, and road safety.
